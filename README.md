# AggieGame 
Aggie Game is a project I developed for my computer science class. 
It is a four-in-a-row game that has a single player mode and a two-player mode.
The objective is for one player to earn 4 consecutive x's in a row.
The program is created using Java, and includes three files: the main program, a utilites file, and a business rule.
